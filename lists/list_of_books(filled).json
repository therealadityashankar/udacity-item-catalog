The original Egyptian name for the text, transliterated rw nw prt m hrw is translated as Book of Coming Forth by Day. Another translation would be Book of Emerging Forth into the Light. \"Book\" is the closest term to describe the loose collection of texts consisting of a number of magic spells intended to assist a dead person's journey through the Duat, or underworld, and into the afterlife and written by many priests over a period of about 1000 years.\nThe Book of the Dead was part of a tradition of funerary texts which includes the earlier Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts, which were painted onto objects, not papyrus. Some of the spells included were drawn from these older works and date to the 3rd millennium BCE. Other spells were composed later in Egyptian history, dating to the Third Intermediate Period (11th to 7th centuries BCE). A number of the spells which made up the Book continued to be inscribed on tomb walls and sarcophagi, as had always been the spells from which they originated. The Book of the Dead was placed in the coffin or burial chamber of the deceased.\nThere was no single or canonical Book of the Dead. The surviving papyri contain a varying selection of religious and magical texts and vary considerably in their illustration. Some people seem to have commissioned their own copies of the Book of the Dead perhaps choosing the spells they thought most vital in their own progression to the afterlife. The Book of the Dead was most commonly written in hieroglyphic or hieratic script on a papyrus scroll, and often illustrated with vignettes depicting the deceased and their journey into the afterlife.\nThe finest of examples we have of the Egyptian Book of the Dead in antiquity is the Papyrus Scroll of Ani, an Egyptian Scribe. It is at the British Museum of Art in London, and was discovered by and was taken out of Egypt in 1888 by Sir E. A. Wallis Budge, and was brought to the London Museum to preserve it, and it is where the Papyrus Scroll of Ani remains unto this day.", "title": "Book of the Dead"}, {"description": "The Amduat (literally \"That Which Is In the Afterworld\", also translated as \"Text of the Hidden Chamber Which is in the Underworld\" and \"Book of What is in the Underworld\") is an important ancient Egyptian funerary text of the New Kingdom of Egypt.

Unlike other funerary texts, however, it was reserved only for pharaohs (until the Twenty-first Dynasty almost exclusively) or very favored nobility.It tells the story of Ra, the Egyptian sun god who travels through the underworld, from the time when the sun sets in the west and rises again in the east. It is said that the dead Pharaoh is taking this same journey, ultimately to become one with Ra and live forever.\nThe underworld is divided into twelve hours of the night, each representing different allies and enemies for the Pharaoh/sun god to encounter. The Amduat names all of these gods and monsters. The main purpose of the Amduat is to give the names of these gods and monsters to the spirit of the dead Pharaoh, so he can call upon them for help or use their name to defeat them.\nAs well as enumerating and naming the inhabitants of the Duat, both good and bad, the illustrations of the work show clearly the topography of the underworld.

It is typically categorised as a nonsense poem. Written from 1874 to 1876, the poem borrows the setting, some creatures, and eight portmanteau words from Carroll's earlier poem \"Jabberwocky\" in his children's novel Through the Looking-Glass (1871).\nAs for the word \"Snark\", Carroll did not give it any meaning. The word \"snarking\" had been used in 1866 to describe a sound.Henry Holiday, the illustrator of the poem, thought of it as a \"tragedy\".The plot follows a crew of ten trying to hunt the Snark, an animal which may turn out to be a highly dangerous Boojum. The only one of the crew to find the Snark quickly vanishes, leading the narrator to explain that it was a Boojum after all. The poem is dedicated to young Gertrude Chataway, whom Carroll met at the English seaside town Sandown in the Isle of Wight in 1875. Included with many copies of the first edition of the poem was Carroll's religious tract, An Easter Greeting to Every Child Who Loves \"Alice\".\nThe Hunting of the Snark was published by Macmillan in the United Kingdom in late March 1876, with illustrations by Henry Holiday. It had mixed reviews from reviewers who found it strange. The first printing of The Hunting of the Snark consisted of 10,000 copies. There were two reprintings by the conclusion of the year; in total, the poem was reprinted 17 times between 1876 and 1908. Carroll often denied knowing the meaning behind the poem; however, in an 1896 reply to one letter, he agreed with one interpretation of the poem as an allegory for the search for happiness. Scholars have found various meanings in the poem, among them existential angst, an allegory for tuberculosis, and a mockery of the Tichborne case.

He became a favourite of the weak king Henry VI of England, and consequently a leading figure in the English government. Due to his influence in state policy, Suffolk came to be associated with many of the royal government's failures of the time, particularly on the war in France, earning him significant unpopularity and eventually leading to his downfall. He also appears prominently in Shakespeare's Henry VI, parts 1 and 2.\nHis early career was spent in the military, fighting in the Hundred Years' War from a young age. Despite missing the Battle of Agincourt due to invalidity, he participated in all subsequent campaigns of Henry V, and after the latter's death, Suffolk continued to serve in France, now for the boy king Henry VI. He was one of the English commanders at the failed Siege of Orl\u00e9ans, in the aftermath of which he was taken prisoner (1429). Ransomed shortly after, Suffolk began entering the world of politics. He favoured a diplomatic rather than military solution to the deteriorating situation in France, a stance which would later resonate well with King Henry VI.\nFollowing the end of Henry VI's minority (1437), Suffolk became a favoured royal councilor. Gradually building his influence throughout the years, he eventually became the dominant figure in the government, and was at the forefront of the main policies conducted during the period. He played a central role in organizing the Treaty of Tours (1444), which established a truce in France and arranged the king's marriage to Margaret of Anjou. Suffolk benefited greatly from his favour with Henry VI, accumulating lucrative posts, estates, and titles. However, the ultimate failure of his policies, the disastrous renewal of the war in France, and other national problems spelt the destruction of Suffolk's career. Many accused him of maladministration and poor conduct of the war, and political pressures forced Suffolk into exile. At the sea on his way out, he was caught by an angry mob, subjected to a mock trial, and beheaded.\nHis estates were forfeited to the crown but later restored to his only son, John. The de la Pole family was never again to achieve the level of influence Suffolk had enjoyed, however. His political successor was instead the Duke of Somerset, whose enmity with various noblemen, combined with the unstable political climate following the final loss in the Hundred Years' War, led to the Wars of the Roses.", "title": "Jackanapes"}, {"description": "The Fifth Form at St. Dominic's (published 1881) is the best known of the school stories by the late nineteenth century author Talbot Baines Reed.

Most of the characters are animals such as Shere Khan the tiger and Baloo the bear, though a principal character is the boy or \"man-cub\" Mowgli, who is raised in the jungle by wolves. The stories are set in a forest in India; one place mentioned repeatedly is \"Seonee\" (Seoni), in the central\nstate of Madhya Pradesh.\nA major theme in the book is abandonment followed by fostering, as in the life of Mowgli, echoing Kipling's own childhood. The theme is echoed in the triumph of protagonists including Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and The White Seal over their enemies, as well as Mowgli's. Another important theme is of law and freedom; the stories are not about animal behaviour, still less about the Darwinian struggle for survival, but about human archetypes in animal form. They teach respect for authority, obedience, and knowing one's place in society with \"the law of the jungle\", but the stories also illustrate the freedom to move between different worlds, such as when Mowgli moves between the jungle and the village. Critics have also noted the essential wildness and lawless energies in the stories, reflecting the irresponsible side of human nature.\nThe Jungle Book has remained popular, partly through its many adaptations for film and other media. Critics such as Swati Singh have noted that even critics wary of Kipling for his supposed imperialism have admired the power of his storytelling.

It is set at a school dubbed \u201cthe College\u201d or \u201cthe Coll.,\u201d which is based on the actual United Services College that Kipling attended as a boy.

For example, Beetle pokes fun at an earlier, more earnest, boys' book, Eric, or, Little by Little, thus flaunting his more worldly outlook. The final chapter recounts events in the lives of the boys when, as adults, they are in the armed forces in India.  It is implied that the mischievous pranks of the boys in school was splendid training for their role as instruments of the British Empire. \nTeddy Roosevelt disdained the novel, calling it \"a story which ought never to have been written, for there is hardly a single form of meanness which it does not seem to extol, or of school mismanagement which it does not seem to applaud.\"", "title": "Stalky & Co."}], "List of autobiographies": [{"title": "The Secret Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed", "description": "The Secret Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed is an autobiography by the internationally renowned artist Salvador Dal\u00ed published in 1942 by Dial Press.

Soon afterward, Colbert reportedly secured a publishing deal for the book. Sendak coincidentally died the morning of the book's release, and, in tribute, The Colbert Report aired uncensored previously unreleased clips of the interview, with Colbert encouraging those unfamiliar with Sendak's work to \"read his books.
